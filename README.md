I'll add a note to the README clarifying that PassFort is a learning project and not intended for production use. Here's the updated version:

# PassFort - Secure Password Manager

PassFort is a simple and secure password manager built using React, Tailwind Css, Express, and MongoDB. It allows users to store multiple website credentials securely with features like password visibility toggle, edit, delete, and copy functionality. The application is deployed using MongoDB Atlas (database), Render (backend), and Vercel (frontend).
